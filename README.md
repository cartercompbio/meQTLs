# meQTLs
Code to reproduce analyses presented in Goudarzi et al

Most of the TAD and meQTL data used in the Jupyter Notebooks provided are present in the TAD_Data and meQTL_Data directories, respectively. However, the large meQTL data set with 1,236,142 meQTLs with unique rsid across all tumor types (in the code represented as unique_meqtls.csv or tad_meqtls.csv) could not have been downloaded. The data comes from Gong et al in the paper "Pancan-meQTL: a database to systematically evaluate the effects of genetic variants on methylation in human cancer". It is made from a simple aggregate of all of cis-meQTLs across all the tumor types, then filtered to unique rsids (with duplicates removed and the first meQTL with the given rsid in the dataset retrieved). We were less concerned about tumor-specific interactions and more about the location/CpG probe/affected gene of the meQTL, allowing us to work with the resulting 1,236,142 meQTLs with unique rsid.
